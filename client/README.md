# Afua Deborah Frimpong

A portfolio remake my old one can be found [here](https://github.com/afuadeborah/portfolio).

Hi! Welcome to my portfolio repository. I'm Afua Deborah, a frontend-focused fullstack developer based out of Canada.

I wanted to update my portfolio to relfect some of the skills I've learned over 5 years into my professional development career so here we are! I've worked as both a frontend and fullstack dev in my previous roles, and am completely comfortable working in backend code if need be, and I have years of creative know-how that I've been able to flex via many UI, design, and frontend green builds.

This project is an SPA made in React and Node.js, and the design is my own using elements I procured from the 98.css component library.
